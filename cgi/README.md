These files should be placed in your cgi-bin directory
(/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/ on OSX), with the rest of the quest/
folder in the same dir, i.e. the dir structure should be:

    /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/quest/  
    /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/navigator.py  
    /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/quest_cgi.py  
    /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/jquery-1.4.4.min.js  

Then navigate to http://localhost/cgi-bin/quest\_cgi.py and you're off!
